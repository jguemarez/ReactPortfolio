          My name is Jonathan Maldonado Guemarez. I came to New Jersey from Puerto Rico, where i got to attend the University of Puerto Rico at both the Mayaguez and Rio Piedras campuses.
          I have an abiding interest in computer science and mathematics. Currently enrolled at Rutgers University's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, I am looking forward to contribute
          with the development of new web-based technologies with an emphasis on the back-end (servers and databases).
